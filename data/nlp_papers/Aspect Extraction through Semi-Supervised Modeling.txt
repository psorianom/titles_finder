Abstract
Aspect extraction is a central problem in
sentiment analysis. Current methods either
extract aspects without categorizing them,
or extract and categorize them using
unsupervised
topic
modeling.
By
categorizing, we mean the synonymous
aspects should be clustered into the same
category. In this paper, we solve the
problem in a different setting where the
user provides some seed words for a few
aspect categories and the model extracts
and clusters aspect terms into categories
simultaneously. This setting is important
because categorizing aspects is a subjective
task. For different application purposes,
different categorizations may be needed.
Some form of user guidance is desired. In
this paper, we propose two statistical
models to solve this seeded problem, which
aim to discover exactly what the user
wants. Our experimental results show that
the two proposed models are indeed able to
perform the task effectively.

Introduction

Aspect-based sentiment analysis is one of the main
frameworks for sentiment analysis (Hu and Liu,
2004; Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012). A key task
of the framework is to extract aspects of entities
that have been commented in opinion documents.
The task consists of two sub-tasks. The first subtask extracts aspect terms from an opinion corpus.
The second sub-task clusters synonymous aspect
terms into categories where each category

represents a single aspect, which we call an aspect
category. Existing research has proposed many
methods for aspect extraction. They largely fall
into two main types. The first type only extracts
aspect terms without grouping them into categories
(although a subsequent step may be used for the
grouping, see Section 2). The second type uses
statistical topic models to extract aspects and group
them at the same time in an unsupervised manner.
Both approaches are useful. However, in practice,
one also encounters another setting, where
grouping is not straightforward because for
different applications the user may need different
groupings to reflect the application needs. This
problem was reported in (Zhai et al., 2010), which
gave the following example. In car reviews,
internal design and external design can be regarded
as two separate aspects, but can also be regarded as
one aspect, called “design”, based on the level of
details that the user wants to study. It is also
possible that the same word may be put in different
categories based on different needs. However,
(Zhai et al., 2010) did not extract aspect terms. It
only categorizes a set of given aspect terms.
In this work, we propose two novel statistical
models to extract and categorize aspect terms
automatically given some seeds in the user
interested categories. It is thus able to best meet the
user’s specific needs. Our models also jointly
model both aspects and aspect specific sentiments.
The first model is called SAS and the second
model is called ME-SAS. ME-SAS improves SAS
by using Maximum-Entropy (or Max-Ent for short)
priors to help separate aspects and sentiment terms.
However, to train Max-Ent, we do not need
manually labeled training data (see Section 4).

In practical applications, asking users to provide
some seeds is easy as they are normally experts in
their trades and have a good knowledge what are
important in their domains.
Our models are related to topic models in
general (Blei et al., 2003) and joint models of
aspects and sentiments in sentiment analysis in
specific (e.g., Zhao et al., 2010). However, these
current models are typically unsupervised. None of
them can use seeds. With seeds, our models are
thus semi-supervised and need a different
formulation. Our models are also related to the DFLDA model in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), which
allows the user to set must-link and cannot-link
constraints. A must-link means that two terms must
be in the same topic (aspect category), and a
cannot-link means that two terms cannot be in the
same topic. Seeds may be expressed with mustlinks and cannot-links constraints. However, our
models are very different from DF-LDA. First of
all, we jointly model aspect and sentiment, while
DF-LDA is only for topics/aspects. Joint modeling
ensures clear separation of aspects from sentiments
producing better results. Second, our way of
treating seeds is also different from DF-LDA. We
discuss these and other related work in Section 2.
The proposed models are evaluated using a large
number of hotel reviews. They are also compared
with two state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental
results show that the proposed models outperform
the two baselines by large margins.

Related Work

There are many existing works on aspect
extraction. One approach is to find frequent noun
terms and possibly with the help of dependency
relations (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni,
2005; Zhuang et al., 2006; Blair-Goldensohn et al.,
2008; Ku et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2009;
Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Qiu et al., 2011).
Another approach is to use supervised sequence
labeling (Liu, Hu and Cheng 2005; Jin and Ho,
2009; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Li et al., 2010;
Choi and Cardie, 2010; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Yu
et al., 2011). Ma and Wan (2010) also exploited
centering theory, and (Yi et al., 2003) used
language models. However, all these methods do
not group extracted aspect terms into categories.
Although there are works on grouping aspect terms
(Carenini et al., 2005; Zhai et al., 2010; Zhai et al.,

340

2011; Guo et al., 2010), they all assume that aspect
terms have been extracted beforehand.
In recent years, topic models have been used to
perform extraction and grouping at the same time.
Existing works are based on two basic models,
pLSA (Hofmann, 1999) and LDA (Blei et al.,
2003). Some existing works include discovering
global and local aspects (Titov and McDonald,
2008), extracting key phrases (Branavan et al.,
2008), rating multi-aspects (Wang et al., 2010;
Moghaddam and Ester, 2011), summarizing
aspects and sentiments (Lu et al., 2009), and
modeling attitudes (Sauper et al., 2011). In (Lu and
Zhai, 2008), a semi-supervised model was
proposed. However, their method is entirely
different from ours as they use expert reviews to
guide the analysis of user reviews.
Aspect and sentiment extraction using topic
modeling come in two flavors: discovering aspect
words sentiment wise (i.e., discovering positive
and negative aspect words and/or sentiments for
each aspect without separating aspect and
sentiment terms) (Lin and He, 2009; Brody and
Elhadad, 2010, Jo and Oh, 2011) and separately
discovering both aspects and sentiments (e.g., Mei
et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2010). Zhao et al. (2010)
used Maximum-Entropy to train a switch variable
to separate aspect and sentiment words. We adopt
this method as well but with no use of manually
labeled data in training. One problem with these
existing models is that many discovered aspects
are not understandable/meaningful to users. Chang
et al. (2009) stated that one reason is that the
objective function of topic models does not always
correlate well with human judgments. Our seeded
models are designed to overcome this problem.
Researchers have tried to generate “meaningful”
and “specific” topics/aspects. Blei and McAuliffe
(2007) and Ramage et al. (2009) used document
label information in a supervised setting. Hu et al.
(2011) relied on user feedback during Gibbs
sampling iterations. Andrzejewski et al. (2011)
incorporated first-order logic with Markov Logic
Networks. However, it has a practical limitation
for reasonably large corpora since the number of
non-trivial groundings can grow to O(N2) where N
is the number of unique tokens in the corpus.
Andrzejewski et al. (2009) used another approach
(DF-LDA) by introducing must-link and cannotlink constraints as Dirichlet Forest priors. Zhai et
al. (2011) reported that the model does not scale up

when the number of cannot-links go beyond 1000
because the number of maximal cliques Q(r) in a
connected component of size |r| in the cannot-link
graph is exponential in r. Note that we could still
experiment with DF-LDA as our problem size is
not so large. We will show in Section 4 that the
proposed models outperform it by a large margin.

Proposed Seeded Models

The standard LDA and existing aspect and
sentiment models (ASMs) are mostly governed by
the phenomenon called “higher-order cooccurrence” (Heinrich, 2009), i.e., based on how
often terms co-occur in different contexts1. This
unfortunately results in many “non-specific” terms
being pulled and clustered. We employ seed sets to
address this issue by “guiding” the model to group
semantically related terms in the same aspect thus
making the aspect more specific and related to the
seeds (which reflect the user needs). For easy
presentation, we will use aspect to mean aspect
category from now on. We replace the multinomial
distribution over words for each aspect (as in
ASMs) with a special two-level tree structured
distribution. The generative process of ASMs
assumes that each vocabulary word is
independently (i.e., not dependent upon other
word-aspect association) and equally probable to
be associated with any aspect. Due to higher-order
co-occurrences, we find conceptually different
terms yet related in contexts (e.g., in hotel domain
terms like stain, shower, walls in aspect
1

w1 co-occurring with w2 which in turn co-occurs with w3 denotes a
second-order co-occurrence between w1 and w3.

Maintenance; bed, linens, pillows in aspect
Cleanliness) equally probable of emission for any
aspect. Figure 1(a) shows an example tree. Upon
adding the seed sets {bed, linens, pillows} and
{staff, service}, the prior structure now changes to
the correlated distribution in Figure 1 (b). Thus,
each aspect has a top level distribution over nonseed words and seed sets. Each seed set in each
aspect further has a second level distribution over
seeds in that seed set. The aspect term (word)
emission now requires two steps: first sampling at
level one to obtain a non-seed word or a seed set. If
a non-seed word is sampled we emit it else we
further sample at the second seed set level and emit
a seed word. This ensures that seed words together
have either all high or low aspect associations.
Furthermore, seed sets preserve conjugacy between
related concepts and also shape more specific
aspects by clustering based on higher order cooccurrences with seeds rather than only with
standard one level multinomial distribution over
words (or terms) alone.

ME-SAS Model

We can further improve SAS by employing
Maximum Entropy (Max-Ent) priors for aspect and
sentiment switching. We call this new model MESAS. The motivation is that aspect and sentiment
terms play different syntactic roles in a sentence.
Aspect terms tend to be nouns or noun phrases
while sentiment terms tend to be adjectives,
adverbs, etc. POS tag information can be elegantly
encoded by moving

Figure 1(d)) and drawing it from a Maxmodel.

Experiments

This section evaluates the proposed models. Since
the focus in this paper is to generate high quality
aspects using seeds, we will not evaluate
sentiments although both SAS and ME-SAS can
also discover sentiments. To compare the
performance with our models, we use two existing
state-of-the-art models, ME-LDA (Zhao et al.
2010) and DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009).
As discussed in Section 2, there are two main
flavors of aspect and sentiment models. The first
flavor does not separate aspect and sentiment, and
the second flavor uses a switch to perform the
separation. Since our models also perform a

343

switch, it is natural to compare with the latter
flavor, which is also more advanced. ME-LDA is
the representative model in this flavor. DF-LDA
adds constraints to LDA. We use our seeds to
generate constraints for DF-LDA. While ME-LDA
cannot consider constraints, DF-LDA does not
separate sentiments and aspects. Apart from other
modeling differences, our models can do both,
which enable them to produce much better results.
Dataset and Settings: We used hotel reviews from
tripadvisor.com. Our corpus consisted of 101,234
reviews and 692,783 sentences. Punctuations, stop
words 3, and words appearing less than 5 times in
the corpus were removed.
For all models, the posterior inference was
drawn after 5000 Gibbs iterations with an initial
burn-in of 1000 iterations. For SAS and ME-SAS,
we set α = 50/T, βA = βO = 0.1 as suggested in
(Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). To make the seeds
more effective, we set the seed set worddistribution hyper-parameter γ to be much larger
than βA, the hyper-parameter for the distribution
over seed sets and aspect terms. This results in
higher weights to seeded words which in turn
guide the sampler to cluster relevant terms better.
A more theoretical approach would involve
performing hyper-parameter estimation (Wallach
et al., 2009) which may reveal specific properties
of the dataset like the estimate of α (indicating how
different documents are in terms of their latent
semantics), β (suggesting how large the groups of
frequently appearing aspect and sentiment terms
are) and γ (giving a sense of which and how large
groupings of seeds are good). These are interesting
questions and we defer it to our future work. In this
work, we found that the setting γ = 250, a larger
value compared to βA, produced good results.
For SAS, the asymmetric Beta priors were
estimated using the method of moments (Section
3.1). We sampled 500 random sentences from the
corpus and for each sentence identified the aspects.
We thus computed the per-sentence probability of
aspect emission ( , ) and used Eq. (4) to compute
the final estimates, which give δa = 2.35, δb = 3.44.
To learn the Max-Ent parameters λ of ME-SAS,
we used the sentiment lexicon 4 of (Hu and Liu,
2004) to automatically generate training data (no
manual labeling). We randomly sampled 1000
terms from the corpus which have appeared at least

20 times (to ensure that the training set is
reasonably representative of the corpus). Of those
1000 terms if they appeared in the sentiment
lexicon, they were treated as sentiment terms, else
aspect terms. Clearly, labeling words not in the
sentiment lexicon as aspect terms may not always
be correct. Even with this noisy automaticallylabeled data, the proposed models can produce
good results. Since ME-LDA used manually
labeled training data for Max-Ent, we again
randomly sampled 1000 terms from our corpus
appearing at least 20 times and labeled them as
aspect terms or sentiment terms, so this labeled
data clearly has less noise than our automatically
labeled data. For both ME-SAS and ME-LDA we
used the corresponding feature vector of each
labeled term (in the context of sentences where it
occurs) to train the Max-Ent model. As DF-LDA
requires must-link and cannot-link constraints, we
used our seed sets to generate intra-seed set mustlink and inter-seed set cannot-link constraints. For
its hyper-parameters, we used the default values in
the package5 (Andrzejewski et al., 2009).
Setting the number of topics/aspects in topic
models is often tricky as it is difficult to know the

exact number of topics that a corpus has. While
non-parametric Bayesian approaches (Teh et al.,
2006) do exist for estimating the number of topics,
T, they strongly depend on the hyper-parameters
(Heinrich, 2009). As we use fixed hyperparameters, we do not learn T from Bayesian nonparametrics. We used 9 major aspects (T = 9)
based on commonsense knowledge of what people
usually talk about hotels and some experiments.
These are Dining, Staff, Maintenance, Check In,
Cleanliness, Comfort, Amenities, Location and
Value for Money (VFM). However, it is important
to note that the proposed models are flexible and
do not need to have seeds for every aspect/topic.
Our experiments simulate the real-life situation
where the user may not know all aspects or have
no seeds for some aspects. Thus, we provided
seeds only to the first 6 of the 9 aspects/topics. We
will see that without seeds for all aspects, our
models not only can improve the seeded aspects
but also improve the non-seeded aspects.

4.1

Qualitative Results
This section shows some qualitative results to give
an intuitive feeling of the results from different
models. Table 1 shows the aspect terms and
sentiment terms discovered by the 4 models for

three aspects. Due to space limitations, we are
unable to show all 6 aspects for which we have
seeds. Since DF-LDA cannot separate aspects and
sentiments, we only show its topics (aspects). Red
(bold) colored words show semantic clustering
errors or inappropriate terms for different groups.
It is important to note that we judge the results
based on how they are related to the user seeds
(which represent the user need). The judgment is to
some extent subjective. What we reported here are
based on our judgments what are appropriate and
what are not for each aspect. For SAS, ME-SAS
and ME-LDA, we mark sentiment terms as errors
when they are grouped under aspects as these
models are supposed to separate sentiments and
aspects. For DF-LDA, the situation is different as it
is not meant to separate sentiment and aspect
terms, we use red italic font to indicate those
adjectives which are aspect specific adjectives (see
more discussion below). Our judgment may be
slightly unfair to ME-LDA and DF-LDA as their
results may make sense in some other ways.
However, that is precisely the purpose of this
work, to produce results that suit the user’s need
rather than something generic.
We can see from Table 1 that ME-SAS performs
the best. Next in order are SAS, ME-LDA, and
DF-LDA. We see that only providing a handful of
seeds (5) for the aspect Staff, ME-SAS can
discover highly specific words like manager,
attendant, bartender, and janitor. By specific, we
mean they are highly related to the given seeds.
While SAS also discovers specific words
benefiting from seeds, relying on Beta priors for
aspect and sentiment switching was less effective.
Next in performance is ME-LDA which although
produces reasonable results in general, several
aspect terms are far from what the user wants
based on the seeds, e.g., room, linens, wait, pillow.
Finally, we observe that DF-LDA does not perform
well either. One reason is that it is unable to
separate aspects and sentiments. Although
encoding the intra-seed set must-link and interseed set cannot-link constraints in DF-LDA
discovers some specific words as ME-SAS, they
are much lower in the ranked order and hence do
not show up in the top 10 words in Table 1. As
DF-LDA is not meant to perform extraction and to
group both aspect and sentiment terms, we relax
the errors of DF-LDA due to correct aspect
specific sentiments (e.g., friendly, helpful for Staff
are correct aspect specific sentiments, but still

345

regard incorrect sentiments like front, comfortable,
large as errors) placed in aspect models. We call
this model DF-LDA-Relaxed.

4.2

Quantitative Results
Topic models are often evaluated quantitatively
using perplexity and likelihood on held-out test
data (Blei et al., 2003). However, perplexity does
not reflect our purpose since our aim is not to
predict whether an unseen document is likely to be
a review of some particular aspect. Nor are we
trying to evaluate how well the unseen review data
fits our seeded models. Instead our focus is to
evaluate how well our learned aspects perform in
clustering specific terms guided by seeds. So we
directly evaluate the discovered aspect terms. Note
again we do not evaluate sentiment terms as they
are not the focus of this paper 6. Since aspects
produced by the models are rankings and we do
not know the number of correct aspect terms, a
natural way to evaluate these rankings is to use
precision @ n (or p@n), where n is a rank position.
Varying number of seeds: Instead of a fixed
number of seeds, we want to see the effect of the
number of seeds on aspect discovery. Table 2
reports the average p@n vs. the number of seeds.
The average is a two-way averaging. The first
average was taken over all combinations of actual
seeds selected for each aspect, e.g., when the
number of seeds is 3, out of the 5 seeds in each
aspect, all 53 combinations of seeds were tried and
the results averaged. The results were further
averaged over p@n for 6 aspects with seeds. We
start with 2 seeds and progressively increase them
to 5. Using only 1 seed per seed set (or per aspect)
has practically no effect because the top level
distribution
encodes which seed sets (and nonseed words) to include; the lower-level distribution
Ω constrains the probabilities of the seed words to
be correlated for each of the seed sets. Thus,
having only one seed per seed set will result in
sampling that single word whenever that seed set is
chosen which will not have the effect of correlating
seed words so as to pull other words based on cooccurrence with constrained seed words. From
Table 2, we can see that for all models p@n
progressively improves as the number of seeds
increases. Again ME-SAS performs the best
followed by SAS and DF-LDA.

Table 3: Effect of performance on seeded and non-seeded aspects (5 seeds were used for the 6 seeded aspects).

Effect of seeds on non-seeded aspects: Here we
compare all models aspect wise and see the results
of seeded models SAS and ME-SAS on nonseeded aspects (Table 3). Shaded cells in Table 3
give the p@n values for DF-LDA, DF-LDARelaxed, SAS, and ME-SAS on three non-seeded
aspects (Amenities, Location, and VFM)7.
We see that across all the first 6 aspects with (5)
seeds ME-SAS outperforms all other models by
large margins in all top 3 ranked buckets p@10,
p@20 and p@30. Next in order are SAS, ME-LDA
and DF-LDA. For the last three aspects which did
not have any seed guidance, we find something
interesting. Seeded models SAS and especially
ME-SAS result in improvements of non-seeded
aspects too. This is because as seeds facilitate
clustering specific and appropriate terms in seeded
aspects, which in turn improves precision on nonseeded aspects. This phenomenon can be clearly
seen in Table 1. In aspect Staff of ME-LDA, we
find pillow and linens being clustered. This is not a
“flaw” of the model per se, but the point here is
pillow and linens happen to co-occur many times
with other words like maintenance, staff, and
upkeep because “room-service” generally includes
staff members coming and replacing linens and
pillow covers. Although pillow and linens are
related to Staff, strictly speaking they are
semantically incorrect because they do not
represent the very concept “Staff” based on the
seeds (which reflect the user need). Presence of

Note that Tables 2 and 3 are different runs of the model. The variations in the
results are due to the random initialization of the Gibbs sampler.

seed sets in SAS and ME-SAS result in pulling
such words as linens and pillow (due to seeds like
beds and cleanliness in the aspect Cleanliness) and
ranking them higher in the aspect Cleanliness (see
Table 1) where they make more sense than Staff.
Lastly, we also note that the improvements in nonseeded aspects are more pronounced for ME-SAS
than SAS as SAS encounters more switching errors
which counters the improvement gained by seeds.
In summary, the averages over all aspects (Table
3 last row) show that the proposed seeded models
SAS and ME-SAS outperform ME-LDA, DF-LDA
and even DF-LDA-Relaxed considerably.

Conclusion

This paper studied the issue of using seeds to
discover aspects in an opinion corpus. To our
knowledge, no existing work deals with this
problem. Yet, it is important because in practice
the user often has something in mind to find. The
results obtained in a completely unsupervised
manner may not suit the user’s need. To solve this
problem, we proposed two models SAS and MESAS which take seeds reflecting the user needs to
discover specific aspects. ME-SAS also does not
need any additional help from the user in its MaxEnt training. Our results showed that both models
outperformed two state-of-the-art existing models
ME-LDA and DF-LDA by large margins.
